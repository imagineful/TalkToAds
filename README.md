# TalkToAds

## What is TalkToAds
TalkToAds is a interactive interface for Bing Ads and Ad Words users.
You can talk to "TalkToAds" in natural language to manage your ads account, instead of call the APIs in your programming,

i.e. you can call Bing Ads / AdWords APIs without knowing anything about programming, you don't need to know Bing Ads API, AdWords either.

all you need to do is talking!

## How to use TalkToAds
If you want to use BingAds, just say "Hi, Bing Ads", then it goes to Bing Ads Mode
TODO. If you want to use AdWords, just say "Hi, AdWords", then it goes to AdWords Mode.

after that, you can talk to your ads system.

then TalkToAds will tell you, "x campaigns fetched from your account, do you want to list all of them?"
....
